### Creating a DEVN scene
* In the project view, navigate to a folder that you would like to create your DEVN scenes in
* Right-click, and select ``` Create/DEVN/Scene ```
* Remember the *"DEVN Canvas"* prefab that was placed on the hierarchy? Navigate to the *"Scene Manager"* component and set the newly created DEVN scene as the *"Start Scene"*
